# marriages

How many people get married per week in Philadelphia? I wanted to know.

So far, I have a simple tool that scrapes the Philadelphia website for marriage data, leveraging the fact that their [marriage search page](http://secureprod.phila.gov/wills/marriagesearch.aspx) supports SQL wildcards. I am currently dumping this data as a CSV. Afterwards, I will perform analysis on it.
